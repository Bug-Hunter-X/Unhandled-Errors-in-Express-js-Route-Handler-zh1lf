# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a route that fails to handle database errors and cases where a requested user doesn't exist.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug

The `/users/:id` route attempts to fetch a user from a database.  However, it lacks appropriate error handling for:

1. **Database Errors:**  Failures during the database query are not caught or handled gracefully. 
2. **User Not Found:**  If the requested user does not exist, the response is not handled properly. 

These omissions can lead to server crashes, unexpected behavior, and unhelpful error messages for users.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version.  It includes comprehensive error handling to catch database errors and handle the case where a user is not found, providing more informative error messages to both the server and client.
